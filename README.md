## Instructions

This game forms part of the requirements for the Udacity FEND nanodegree.

It's quite a simple game. The aim is to identify all 8 pairs within the deck.  

1. Click a card to reveal its symbol
2. Click a second card
     1. If these 2 match then the cards will turn green, showing that a pair has been identified and they will not flip back over.
     2. If they do not match then they will flip back over, hiding the symbol, and the player can try again
2. Keep going until all pairs are found
